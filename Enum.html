								<p> The Fall of 2013, was a rough year for me. I just recently signed a new lease about 3 miles out off campus, which in the grand scheme of things isnt that bad but back then it felt like a life time away from everything that was happening on campus. I had to bike in, or risk driving which usually led in some type of ticket becuase my classes would tend to run over (or I would be running later). It was my Junior year and I knew I needed to start thinking about full time work post college. We were still in the mist of the great recession and the prospects of the market didnt look appealing to me. So what did I do you ask? I spent every night on USAJOBs looking for internships and applying to everything and anything that listed on the site. Yes it wasnt the best/smartest use of my time. Some of the jobs were for HR to Finance (cliff notes I was a Poli Sci major) to IT.  For about 4 months every night, I would put in about 5 applications or more to various government internships. </p>
								<p> For all my work I didnt get any phone calls or emails back saying thank you for applying. But about 6 months later towards the end of the summer I got a Call from the State Department asking if I would like to intern with their CTO shop. I dont know if it was my 12 month college job as an help desk anaylst or my steller resume (I was working at cold stone at the time) but I got my first real internship. That internship hands down is what led me down the road to where I am now. That internship allowed me to get my first background check and Part time job that I could continue while I was in college which also led to my first real full time job. I guess what I am trying to say is that qualifications are not everything, if you think you are a good fit, apply for the job and see what they say, dont pull yourself out of the running because you dont think you will fit.. </p>
